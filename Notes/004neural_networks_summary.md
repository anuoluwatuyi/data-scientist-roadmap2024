## Training process of a neural network

**1. Initialization:**

* **Random Weights and Biases:** The process begins by assigning random initial values to the weights and biases in the neural network. These parameters define how the network transforms input data.

**2. Forward Propagation:**

* **Input Data:** The neural network receives input data.
* **Calculation:** Each neuron performs calculations based on its inputs, weights, biases, and activation function.
* **Output:** This process continues layer by layer, culminating in the network producing an output prediction.

**3. Loss Function:**

* **Comparison:** The predicted output is compared to the actual target output using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy). The loss function quantifies the difference between the prediction and the truth.

**4. Backpropagation:**

* **Gradient Calculation:** Backpropagation calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. The gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of change needed to reduce the loss. It's computed using the chain rule from calculus.

**5. Gradient Descent:**

* **Update Parameters:** Gradient descent (or a variant like Stochastic Gradient Descent) uses the calculated gradients to update the weights and biases. The goal is to iteratively adjust these parameters to minimize the loss.
* **Learning Rate:** The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size in each update. It determines how much the parameters change with each iteration. A proper learning rate is crucial to ensure the model converges to an optimal solution.

**6. Iteration:**

* **Repeat:** Steps 2-5 are repeated for multiple epochs (iterations over the entire dataset). With each epoch, the network gets better at making predictions.

**7. Evaluation:**

* **Performance Assessment:**  The model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data and doesn't overfit to the training data.

**Key Points:**

* **Gradient Descent vs. Backpropagation:** Gradient descent is the optimization algorithm that guides the update of parameters. Backpropagation is the method used to calculate the gradients required for gradient descent.
* **Step Size:**  The step size in parameter updates is determined by the learning rate and the magnitude of the gradient. The learning rate needs to be carefully tuned to avoid overshooting or slow convergence.
* **Convergence:** The iterative process continues until the loss function reaches a minimum or the improvement becomes negligible.
