### 1. Rule-Based Systems
Early NLP relied on handcrafted rules and linguistic knowledge to analyze and generate text. These systems were rigid and lacked the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.

---

### 2. Statistical Models
Methods like n-grams and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were introduced, relying on statistical patterns in language data. While more flexible than rule-based systems, they still had limited capacity to capture complex dependencies in text.

---
### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)


**Core Concepts:**

* **Sequential Data:** RNNs are designed to process sequential data, where the order of inputs matters (e.g., text, time series, music).
* **Hidden State (Memory):**  RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps, allowing them to model dependencies across time.
* **Parameter Sharing:** The same weights are used across all time steps, making RNNs efficient for learning patterns in sequences of varying lengths.

**RNN Architecture:**

  ![Alt text](image-5.png)


1. **Input Layer**: Accepts the input data at each time step. The input can be a sequence of vectors, where each vector represents a feature at a specific time.

2. **Hidden Layer**: Contains recurrent units that maintain a hidden state. The output from the previous time step is fed back into the network along with the current input, allowing the network to remember information from earlier inputs.

3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final output based on the hidden state. This can vary depending on the task (e.g., classification, prediction).

**Mathematical Representation**
![Alt text](image-6.png)
At each time step \( t \):

- The hidden state \( h_t \) is updated using:
\[ a^t = g_1(W_{aa}a^{t-1} + W_{ax}x^t + b_a) \]
  where:
  - **\( a^t \)**: This denotes the hidden state of the RNN at time step \( t \). The hidden state captures information from previous time steps and is used to make predictions. 
  - **\( g_1 \)**: This is the activation function applied to the hidden layer. Common choices for \( g_1 \) include the tanh function or the ReLU function. 
  - **\( W_{aa} \)**: This is the weight matrix that connects the previous hidden state \( a^{t-1} \) to the current hidden state \( a^t \). The weights in this matrix determine how much influence the previous hidden state has on the current one. 
  - **\( a^{t-1} \)**: This represents the hidden state of the RNN at the previous time step \( t-1 \). It contains information from all previous time steps up to \( t-1 \). 
  - **\( W_{ax} \)**: This is the weight matrix that connects the current input \( x^t \) to the hidden state \( a^t \). The weights in this matrix determine how much influence the current input has on the hidden state. 
  - **\( x^t \)**: This denotes the input at time step \( t \). The input could be a word embedding, a feature vector, or any other type of sequential data. 
  - **\( b_a \)**: This is the bias term for the hidden layer. It allows the model to shift the hidden state activation function, providing additional flexibility in fitting the data.

- The output \( y_t \) is computed as: 
  \[ y^t = g_2(W_{ya}a^t + b_y) \]
  where \( W_{ya} \) are the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer, and \( b_y \) is the output bias.


**Key Properties**

- **Shared Weights**: The same weights are used across all time steps, reducing the number of parameters and enabling the model to learn temporal dependencies.
  -  the weights (the numerical values that determine how strongly different parts of the input influence the output) are not unique for each time step. Instead, the same set of weights is used for processing the input at every point in the sequence.
  -  **Why It's Important**:
     -  **Parameter Efficiency**: Imagine processing a sentence with 100 words. If we had separate weights for each word position, we'd need an enormous number of parameters. Weight sharing drastically reduces the parameter count, making the model more computationally manageable.
     -  **Learning Temporal Patterns**: Because the same weights are applied to different parts of the sequence, the RNN can learn general patterns that hold across time. For instance, in language processing, it might learn that the word "the" often precedes a noun.
     -  **Generalization to Different Sequence Lengths**: Weight sharing means the model doesn't care if you feed it a sentence with 10 words or 100 words. It can apply the same learned patterns regardless of the sequence length, making it more flexible and adaptable.

- **Memory**: The hidden state acts as a memory that retains information from previous inputs, allowing the network to consider context when making predictions.
  - **Why It's Important**:
    - **Capturing Dependencies**: Many real-world sequences have dependencies across time. For example, in a sentence, the meaning of a word often depends on the words that came before it. The hidden state enables the RNN to capture these dependencies, allowing it to make more accurate predictions.
    - **Temporal Context**: Consider a time-series analysis task (e.g., predicting stock prices). The current price depends not just on the most recent data point, but also on the trend over the past several days. The hidden state allows the RNN to incorporate this historical context.

**Types of RNNs:**

* **One-to-One:** Vanilla neural network (not truly recurrent).
* **One-to-Many:** Used for image captioning, music generation.
* **Many-to-One:** Used for sentiment analysis, text classification.
* **Many-to-Many:** Used for machine translation, named entity recognition.

**Challenges:**

* **Vanishing Gradients:**  Gradients can shrink exponentially during backpropagation through time, making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies.
  * This happens because the gradients are computed through a chain of multiplications, and if the weights or the derivatives of the activation functions are less than 1, these multiplications can result in exponentially shrinking values.
  * **Impact**: When gradients vanish, the RNN struggles to learn and adjust the weights in the earlier layers of the network. This makes it difficult for the model to capture long-term dependencies in the data.
  * **Solutions**:
    * **Activation Functions**: Using activation functions like ReLU, which have derivatives of 1 for positive values, can mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
    * **Weight Initialization**: Careful initialization of weights can also help prevent gradients from vanishing too quickly.
    * **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: These are specialized RNN architectures that incorporate gates to regulate the flow of information, effectively addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
* **Exploding Gradients:** Gradients can grow exponentially, leading to instability during training.
  * This occurs similarly to the vanishing gradient problem but in the opposite directionâ€”when the weights or the derivatives of the activation functions are greater than 1, the chain of multiplications during backpropagation can lead to exponentially growing values.
  * **Impact**: Large gradients can cause the weight updates to be so large that the model parameters become unstable and the training process diverges. This can result in the model making poor predictions or even causing numerical overflow errors.
  * **Solutions**:
    * **Gradient Clipping**: This technique involves capping the gradient values to a threshold if they exceed a certain magnitude. By clipping the gradients, the training process remains stable.
    * **Weight Regularization**: Adding regularization terms to the loss function can discourage the weights from growing too large, helping to prevent exploding gradients.
    * **Careful Learning Rate Selection**: Using a smaller learning rate can reduce the magnitude of the weight updates, mitigating the risk of exploding gradients.


**Applications:**

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text generation.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Stock prediction, anomaly detection.
* **Speech Recognition:** Automatic speech transcription.
* **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.

**Interview Tips:**

* **Applications:**  Discuss real-world applications of RNNs and specific examples of how they are used.
* **Challenges:** Be prepared to explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and solutions (LSTMs, GRUs, covered below).

* **Definitions:** Know the key terms (hidden state, parameter sharing, etc.).
* **Architectures:** Understand the different types of RNNs (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.) and their use cases.
* **Mathematics:** Be familiar with the equations used to calculate the hidden state and output.
* **Challenges & Solutions:**  Be able to explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and its solutions.

Lets talk about them one by one.
- **GRU**
  - GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs with fewer gates.
  - They combine the forget and input gates into a single update gate.
  - GRUs are generally faster to train and have fewer parameters than LSTMs, but they may not be as effective in capturing complex dependencies.
- **LSTM**
  - [Animation link](https://packaged-media.redd.it/afzlbpt2ncg81/pb/m2-res_720p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&v=1&e=1722204000&s=961305c3c0633ec1c3def4dca2681f828101cc0e#t=0)

  - LSTMs are a more sophisticated type of RNN with additional gates (input, forget, and output gates) to control the flow of information through the network.
  - The forget gate determines what information to discard from the previous hidden state.
  - The input gate decides what new information to store in the cell state.
  - The output gate determines what information to output from the cell state.

### 4. Transformers
**Attention Is All You Need:** Transformers replaced recurrence with the self-attention mechanism, enabling parallel processing of input elements and capturing long-range dependencies more effectively.

**Rise of Pre-trained Models:** Large-scale pre-trained transformer models like BERT and GPT emerged, leveraging massive amounts of text data to learn general language representations. These models could be fine-tuned for specific tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various NLP benchmarks.

**Multimodal Transformers:** Transformers have expanded beyond text, with applications in image processing (Vision Transformers), audio processing, and even protein folding (AlphaFold). They have demonstrated the potential to unify different modalities within a single architecture.

**Steps:**
1. **Input Representation**
   - Tokenization: Input text is split into words/subwords/characters (tokens). Each token is assigned a unique numerical ID.
   - Embedding: Token IDs are converted into dense vector representations of fixed size (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning.

2. **Positional Encoding:** Information about the position of each token in the sequence is added to the embeddings, as transformers don't inherently process word order (as RNNs do).

3. **Transfomer Architecture:** Has Encoder and Decoder. 
   **Encoder**
   - **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: 
     - **Self-Attention Calculation**: Each token attends to every other token in the sequence to weigh their importance.
       - **Query, Key, Value Vectors**: For each token, three vectors (query, key, and value) are computed using learned weight matrices.
       - **Attention Scores**: The attention score for a token is computed as the dot product of the query vector with the key vectors of all tokens, followed by a softmax operation to get the attention weights.
       - **Weighted Sum**: Each token's output is a weighted sum of the value vectors, weighted by the attention scores.
     - **Multi-Head Mechanism**: Multiple self-attention mechanisms (heads) are run in parallel to capture different aspects of the relationships between tokens.
     - **Concatenation and Linear Transformation**: The outputs of the multiple heads are concatenated and passed through a linear transformation.

   - **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: After the self-attention layer, the output is passed through a feed-forward neural network (FFN), which consists of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.</span>

   - **Add & Norm**: Residual connections and layer normalization are applied after both the self-attention and feed-forward layers to stabilize and improve the training process.

    **Decoder**
      - Similar to the encoder but with an additional layer of multi-head attention over the encoderâ€™s output to incorporate the encoded input context into the generation process.


4. **Output Generation**
- In tasks like machine translation or text generation, the decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time, using previously generated tokens as input, until an end-of-sequence token is produced.

1. **Training**
- **Loss Function**: The model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output using a loss function like cross-entropy loss.
- **Optimization**: Parameters are updated using an optimization algorithm like Adam to minimize the loss.

#### Summary of Key Steps:
1. **Input Representation**: Tokenization and Embedding
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adding positional information
3. **Encoder**:
   - Multi-Head Self-Attention
   - Feed-Forward Neural Network
   - Add & Norm
4. **Decoder** (if applicable): Generating output sequence
5. **Training**: Minimizing loss to improve predictions

**How to work on word level and sentence level tasks?**
1. **Word-Level Tasks (e.g., Named Entity Recognition):**

   1. Classification Layer:
      - Purpose: Predicts the entity type (e.g., person, organization, location) for each token in the input sentence.
      - Implementation: A linear layer is added on top of BERT's output for each token position. This layer outputs a probability distribution over all possible entity types.

   2. Training Data:
      - Format:  Each word in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding entity type. 
      - Example: "John Smith works at Google." would be labeled as "John Smith (PERSON), works (O), at (O), Google (ORGANIZATION)."
      - Objective: During fine-tuning, BERT learns to associate the token representations with their respective entity types based on the labeled data.

2. **Sentence-Level Tasks (e.g., Sentiment Analysis):**

   1. Pooling:
      - Purpose: Aggregates token-level embeddings from BERT's output into a single vector representing the entire sentence.
      - Strategies:
         - Mean Pooling: Averages the embeddings of all tokens in the sentence.
         - Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value for each dimension across all tokens.
         - [CLS] Token Embedding: Uses the embedding of the special classification token ([CLS]) added at the beginning of the sentence, as it often captures sentence-level information.

   2. Classification Layer:
      - Purpose: Predicts the overall sentiment or label for the entire sentence.
      - Implementation: A linear layer is added on top of the sentence-level embedding. This layer outputs a probability distribution over the possible labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

   3. Training Data:
      - Format: Each sentence in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding sentiment or label.
      - Example: "I love this movie!" would be labeled as "positive."
      - Objective: BERT learns to map sentence-level representations to their corresponding labels based on the training data.

3. Key Considerations:

   * Loss Function: Typically, cross-entropy loss is used for classification tasks.
   * Optimization: Adam optimizer is often employed for fine-tuning.
   * Hyperparameters: Experiment with learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to optimize performance.
   * Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers simplifies the fine-tuning process by providing pre-trained BERT models and easy-to-use APIs.
