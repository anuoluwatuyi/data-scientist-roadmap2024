HR R1
Starts with short description about the company and the role & responsibilities. 
1. Tell me about yourself and your journey.
2. What experience do you have with AWS?
3. Used Lambda in AWS?

Unfortunatelly the interview ended within 15-20 minutes as for them not knowing Lambda was deal-breaker.
